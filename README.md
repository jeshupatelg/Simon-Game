# Simon-Game
In this project, I have tried to replicate the renowned Simon game using JavaScript.It simulates a random pattern and the player is required to input the same pattern. If the input matches the pattern, the player wins and advances to the next stage. If the input doesn't match the pattern, the player loses. Here CSS animation is also used.
